**Portfolio Website**
A website to showoff all my projects, and implement _MERN stack_, _Authentication_, _Authorization_, _Encryption (RSA, Diffie Hellman)_ and _Security  policies_. This website itself will be my project as well, so neat UI is required. Need to figure out a way to host this website and also _show Java projects on the website_.
